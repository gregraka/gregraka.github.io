# Quickstart for Administrators

This section is for ownCloud administrators, persons who install and configure the ownCloud server.

If you are an ownCloud user, please contact your administrator for information about how to connect to the ownCloud server.

## Important Note
This document is a quickstart for installing and configuring an ownCloud server
on a Linux system for small workgroups and departments. If your site does not 
fit this scenario, see the [ownCloud Server Administration Manual](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/contents.html).
