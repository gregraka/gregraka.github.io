# Quickstart for Administrators
This section is for ownCloud administrators, persons who install and configure the ownCloud server.

**If you are an ownCloud user, please contact your administrator for information about how to connect to the ownCloud server.**

## Important Note
This document is a quickstart for installing and configuring an ownCloud server
on a Linux system for small workgroups and departments. If your site does not 
fit this scenario, see the [ownCloud Server Administration Manual](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/contents.html).

## Overview

* Enable users to connect.
* Add user accounts.
