# Step 4: Add ownCloud Users
By default, the ownCloud web client is also installed on the ownCloud server machine.
When you log into the web client with your administrator credentials, you can perform 
tasks such as creating user accounts.

   **NOTE:** There is also an ownCloud command line interface that you can use to perform
   adminstration tasks. See [Using occ core commands](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/server/occ_command.html).

## Add a User
To create a user account using the ownCloud web client, follow these steps:

1. With a web browser enter the ownCloud server HTTP address (for example, http://studio/owncloud).

2. When prompted, enter your administrator username and password.

3. Navigate to **User Management** page.

3. Enter the new user's login name and their initial password (cannot be "0").

4. Optionally, assign Groups memberships

5. Click **Create**.

## Give Information to ownCloud Users
Remember to provide your users the following crucial information:
* HTTP address to the ownCloud server (for example, http://studio/owncloud).
* Usernames and their passwords.

Congratulations! Your site's ownCloud server is ready to use.
