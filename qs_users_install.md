# Step 2: Install the Client
After you have verified that your device meets the necessary [system requirements](./qs_users_sysreqs.html), 
you must install the ownCloud client.

The ownCloud client runs on your workstation, laptop, tablet, and so on and enables 
you to connect to a server where you can use ownCloud.

## Run the Client Installation Wizard
1. Your ownCloud administrator has provided you with the following:
   - the location of the client installation program (ownCloud-x.y.z.msi).
   - the address of the ownCloud server (for example, https://studio/owncloud).
   - your ownCloud username and password.

   Contact your ownCloud administrator if you do not have this information.

2. Open Windows explorer, navigate to the folder where the installation program resides, and double-click ownCloud-x.y.z.msi.
