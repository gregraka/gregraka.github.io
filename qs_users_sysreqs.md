# Step 1: Download and Install the ownCloud Client
The ownCloud client runs on your workstation, laptop, tablet, and so on, and enables 
you to connect to a server where you can use ownCloud.

You download and run the installation program, the **ownCloud Setup Wizard**, 
to install the ownCloud client.

on a Windows device. If you are on a non-Windows device, see your ownCloud 
administrator.**
